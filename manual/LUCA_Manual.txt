PROJECT L.U.C.A. (Ultimate Edition)
Version: 2.0.0 (Ouroboros Enabled) Classification: Morphogenetic AI with Metaprogramming Capabilities
1. New Modules (The Edge)
* luca_reality.py: Reality Distortion Engine. Suspends internal physics constants (Gravity/Logic) to allow impossible computation.
* luca_ouroboros.py: Metaprogramming Engine. Allows LUCA to dynamically rewrite its own functions in memory (contained safe-mode).
2. Usage
Run python run_luca.py to witness the genesis event and the activation of the Ouroboros Protocol.
3. Safety Protocols
The Ouroboros Engine operates in Memory Only. It uses dynamic monkey-patching to evolve the running instance. It does not overwrite source files on disk, ensuring the "contained booster" effect requested.
